<h2 style="color:#336B67"> <b><u>Font Families</u></b> </h2>
<p> In writing, fonts are sets of letters with particular styles. There is a huge variety of fonts that can be grouped into three font families – Serif, Sans Serif and Script. </p>

<div class="sectionodd">
<h2 style="color:#5C503A"> <b><u>Serif Family</u></b> </h2>
<p> Firstly, the Serif family features fonts with small lines added to each letter. Serif fonts tend to include variations in line thickness and popular fonts include Times New Roman, Georgia and Cambria. These fonts are typically easy to read even when in large paragraphs. They also look great enlarged as titles or headers, with a traditional feel. The headers of this page are written in a Serif font! </p>

<div class="sectioneven">
<h2 style="color:#336B67"> <b><u>Sans Serif Family</u></b> </h2>
<p> Secondly, the Sans Serif family of fonts does not feature serif lines and lack variation in line thickness. As such, the letters appear clean and uniform. These make them perfect for long chunks of texts that give off a modern look. Popular Sans Serif fonts include Arial, Calibri and Verdana. However, they may look plain if enlarged as headers. As such, they are usually limited to the body paragraphs of text. This text is written in a Sans Serif font! </p>

<div class="sectionodd">
<h2 style="color:#5C503A"> <b><u>Script Family</u></b> </h2>
<p> Thirdly, the Script family of fonts, sometimes known as cursive fonts, is modelled after actual handwriting. These fonts feature variation in line thickness and letters that are connected. The most decorative of the three font families, script fonts are often also slanted in one direction and give off a fun and aesthetic feel. However, script fonts generally have lower readability and as such are used in larger elements and not body paragraphs. This is the font family we will be focusing on subsequently as calligraphy makes use of script fonts.  </p>

<h2 style="color:#336B67"> <b><u>Forming Letters</u></b> </h2>
<p> Calligraphy involves the use of basic strokes to form letters. Below are the basic strokes, and a video to guide you through them. Next, these strokes are combined to form letters.  </p>
